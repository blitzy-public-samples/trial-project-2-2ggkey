## Overview

The Task Management System backend is a robust, scalable microservices architecture designed to support enterprise-grade task and project management capabilities. This system implements a modern, cloud-native approach using containerized services, API Gateway pattern, and event-driven communication.

### Key Features
- Microservices-based architecture for scalability and maintainability
- API Gateway for centralized request handling and security
- JWT-based authentication and RBAC authorization
- Real-time updates via WebSocket connections
- Comprehensive monitoring and logging
- Automated deployment pipelines
- Security-first approach with regular vulnerability scanning

### Service Communication
- REST APIs for synchronous communication
- RabbitMQ for asynchronous event handling
- Redis for caching and real-time updates
- Service mesh for inter-service communication

## Services

### API Gateway (Kong v3.4+)
- Central entry point for all client requests
- Rate limiting: 1000 requests/minute per client
- JWT validation and route protection
- Request/Response transformation
- Detailed configuration in `api-gateway/README.md`

### Auth Service (Node.js 18 LTS)
- User authentication and authorization
- JWT token management
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- OAuth2/OIDC integration
- See `auth-service/README.md` for details

### Task Service (Java 17 LTS)
- Core task management functionality
- Project organization
- Team collaboration features
- Real-time updates
- Documentation in `task-service/README.md`

### File Service (Go 1.21+)
- File upload/download management
- S3 integration
- File metadata handling
- Virus scanning

### Notification Service (Python 3.11+)
- Email notifications
- Real-time WebSocket updates
- SMS integration (optional)
- Event-driven architecture

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Docker 24.0+
- Docker Compose 2.20+
- Make
- Git
- Node.js 18 LTS
- Java 17 LTS
- Go 1.21+
- Python 3.11+

### Initial Setup
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository_url>
cd src/backend

# Configure environment
cp .env.example .env

# Start services
docker-compose up -d

# Initialize services
make init-services

# Setup monitoring
make setup-monitoring
```

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch from `develop`
2. Implement changes following style guide
3. Write tests (unit, integration)
4. Run local verification
```bash
make verify      # Runs linting, tests, security checks
make test        # Runs test suite
make security-scan # Runs security analysis
```
5. Create pull request

## Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- Development: `config/dev`
- Staging: `config/staging`
- Production: `config/prod`

### Deployment Process
```bash
# Build services
make build ENV=<environment>

# Deploy services
make deploy ENV=<environment>

# Verify deployment
make verify-deployment ENV=<environment>
```

### Rollback Procedure
```bash
make rollback VERSION=<version> ENV=<environment>
```

## Security

### Security Measures
- TLS 1.3 enforcement
- JWT with refresh tokens
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection
- Regular security scanning
- Audit logging
- OWASP Top 10 compliance

### Security Scanning
```bash
# Run security checks
make security-scan
make dependency-check
make audit-logs
```

## Monitoring

### Monitoring Stack
- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana for visualization
- ELK Stack for log aggregation
- Alert Manager for notifications

### Health Checks
- Liveness probes: `/health/live`
- Readiness probes: `/health/ready`
- Metrics endpoint: `/metrics`

### Logging
- Structured JSON logging
- Correlation IDs
- Log levels: DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR
- Centralized log aggregation

## Contributing

### Code Style
- Follow language-specific style guides
- Use provided linting configurations
- Document public APIs
- Write comprehensive tests

### Pull Request Process
1. Create feature branch
2. Implement changes
3. Write/update tests
4. Update documentation
5. Create pull request
6. Pass CI/CD checks
7. Get code review approval
