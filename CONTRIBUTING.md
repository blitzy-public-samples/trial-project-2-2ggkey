## Introduction

Welcome to the Task Management System project. This document provides comprehensive guidelines for contributing to our enterprise-grade task management solution. We aim to maintain high standards of code quality, security, and performance while fostering an inclusive and collaborative development environment.

### Project Mission
Our mission is to deliver a robust, secure, and scalable task management platform that reduces administrative overhead by 40% and improves project delivery times by 25%.

### Types of Contributions
We welcome the following types of contributions:
- Feature development
- Bug fixes and security patches
- Documentation improvements
- Performance optimizations
- Test coverage improvements
- Security enhancements

### Code of Conduct
All contributors are expected to adhere to our Code of Conduct, which promotes a respectful and inclusive environment for collaboration.

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools installed:
- Node.js (v18.x LTS)
- Java Development Kit (JDK 17 LTS)
- Go (v1.21+)
- Python (v3.11+)
- Docker (v24.0+)
- Kubernetes (v1.27+)
- Git (latest version)

### Environment Setup
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/task-management-system
   cd task-management-system
   ```
3. Set up development dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ./mvnw install
   go mod download
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Local Development Workflow
1. Create a feature branch
2. Implement changes
3. Run local tests
4. Submit pull request

## Contribution Process

### Branch Naming Convention
Use the following prefixes for branches:
- `feature/` - New features
- `bugfix/` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/` - Critical fixes for production
- `release/` - Release preparation
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `security/` - Security-related changes

Example: `feature/task-assignment-workflow`

### Commit Message Guidelines
Follow the Conventional Commits specification:
```
<type>(<scope>): <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer]
```

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation
- `style`: Code style changes
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks
- `security`: Security-related changes

### Pull Request Process
1. Create a PR against the `main` branch
2. Fill out the PR template completely
3. Ensure all checks pass:
   - CI/CD pipeline
   - Code coverage (minimum 80%)
   - Security scans
   - Performance benchmarks
4. Request reviews from relevant team members
5. Address review feedback
6. Maintain PR hygiene (squash commits, rebase if needed)

## Code Standards

### Testing Requirements
- Unit Tests: Required for all new code
- Integration Tests: Required for API changes
- E2E Tests: Required for user-facing features
- Security Tests: Required for security-related changes
- Performance Tests: Required for performance-critical paths

Coverage Requirements:
- Minimum 80% code coverage
- Critical paths require 100% coverage

### Performance Requirements
- API Response Time: <200ms
- Page Load Time: <2s
- Concurrent Users Support: 1000+
- Memory Usage: Optimized and documented
- CPU Usage: Monitored and optimized

### Documentation Requirements
- API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)
- Code comments for complex logic
- Architecture decision records (ADRs)
- Updated README.md when needed
- Security considerations documented

## Security Guidelines

### Security Best Practices
1. Follow OWASP Top 10 guidelines
2. Implement security by design
3. Use approved security libraries
4. Regular dependency updates
5. Secure coding practices

### Security Tools Integration
- Snyk: Dependency vulnerability scanning
- SonarQube: Code quality and security analysis
- OWASP Dependency Check: Third-party component scanning

### Compliance Requirements
All contributions must adhere to:
- GDPR requirements
- SOC 2 Type II controls
- ISO 27001 standards

### Security Review Process
1. Security review required for:
   - Authentication changes
   - Authorization changes
   - Data handling modifications
   - Security-related fixes
2. Security team sign-off required
3. Vulnerability assessment
4. Penetration testing for critical changes

### Vulnerability Reporting
- Report security vulnerabilities privately
- Use security advisory feature
- Do not create public issues for security bugs
- Follow responsible disclosure practices
